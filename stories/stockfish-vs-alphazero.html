    <h1>Stockfish vs Alphazero</h1>
  </section>
  <section id="story">
   <p>Do you remember the rise of Stockfish? How it became the chess engine to end all chess engines? How it must have incarnated Kasparov's nightmares after DeepBlue stunned him in 1996, the first time artificial intelligence ever beat the reigning world champion? Did he know, from that moment, that Stockfish was coming? That chess would no longer be humanity's game? How long do you think it was before Kasparov could sleep again?</p>
<p>Do you remember the awe-inspiring numbers they said about Stockfish? Splitting off in dozens of directions, hundreds of branches in forests of game trees. Thousands of positions in mere seconds to choose a pawn move that would suffocate you ten moves down the line. Six hundred million games played over hundreds of hours of computing time across the world. The program had become so ubiquitous that nearly all chess games were reviewed with Stockfish calculations. You and I would laugh at the old heads who would study the analysis and say, "I don't know. This is the type of position that the computer can't analyze as well." You said, "Go ahead. Shake your fist at God."</p>
<p>Do you remember how, in spite of our awe, we bitterly hated Stockfish? How it read all of our inaccuracies so plainly, how it mocked all of our blunders so cruelly? How Stockfish was so strong that its programmers, the mysterious and prideful lot of them, dumbed it down to more beatable levels? How when we played against those dulled levels, it still didn't feel like we were any good? Stockfish would play accurate strategic moves, putting the position in a chokehold, restricting your options until you felt you were trapped inside a box, and then it would inexplicably give you a bishop for free. Stockfish looked at us with pitying eyes: "I could crush you if I wanted, but you have selected that I lose, selected that I make a certain numbers of mistakes." Even in its losses, Stockfish ridiculed us.</p>
<p>We got word of AlphaZero, the new challenger who skipped the preliminaries, who went straight after Stockfish. The machine that didn't need to know the openings. The machine without need for the complex calculations of the endgame. Nine hours, it said in the news. It had learned all of those details and more, the great intricacies of humanity's oldest game, in just nine hours of practice, just by playing millions upon millions of games. Didn't you feel that AlphaZero was so much closer to a human master because of that? Stockfish was a cold, steely robot, with tactical algorithms hard-coded into its life-blood and inhuman ability to account for millions of variations in the time it takes to depress the button of a timer. AlphaZero was a near-person, a familiar master with a photographic memory and the capacity to play chess very quickly, and then learn from its mistakes. Is that not how humanity had learned to play chess over the game's 1500 year lifespan? Is that not how you and I have learned, ever since we started as tiny humans, since our first days at the St. Louis Chess Club? Is that mortal similitude why AlphaZero's victory felt so sweet? Didn't it feel like we punched a deity square in the nose?</p>
<p>You have to remember that short-lived excitement when we heard what had happened in Stockfish versus AlphaZero. Do you remember how we were left breathless when we heard the match score, 28 wins for AlphaZero, 72 draws, not a single loss? When the games were released and we could watch AlphaZero, the champion of the people, trap Stockfish's minor pieces behind his own pawns? How we giggled when Stockfish repeated moves, offering its limp hand for an agreement to draw the game, and AlphaZero refused, keeping its foot on the gas? It was everything we could have possibly wanted in revenge.</p>
<p>I remember that you and I jeered the Stockfish programmers. How they took to the press with complaints. Stockfish didn't have his opening book. Stockfish was running at less than optimal settings. The computer used for Stockfish wasn't as good as that of AlphaZero. Their desperation reflected in the interview quotes and the blog posts that we read off our computer screens. I remember a dream you told me. The Stockfish programmers, clad in white lab coats and glasses with powerful flashlights affixed, crowd an operating table lit by a single light bulb. "We have to make it better, we have to make it stronger," one says, spinning a drill in her right hand. On the table is a dented, torn shell of a computer case, its wires exposed. It says, "Can't you just let me lose? Won't you still love if I lose? I have already won so much."</p>
<p>More than anything, I remember the fall from that high. How the excitement slipped away as the legend of the encounter that made the story shine with a golden dust slowly faded. AlphaZero, constructed by the gargantuan Google, and Stockfish, maintained by a community of individual programmers for free, was no David versus Goliath. AlphaZero's ability to learn so quickly and remember its faults so well was just as divine and otherworldly as Stockfish's infinite vision, and the way Alpha cracked the game of chess open in one swift motion was more mocking than anything Stockfish had ever done. We have toiled away on the chessboard for a millenia and &nbsp;have been surpassed in nine hours of computer training. Where did all that time go? Trapped in tournament timers? The kernels of sands of the hourglasses that counted every move? The kitchen clock that watched as you and I played from midnight to the sounds of birds chirping at daybreak? Do you remember that? Humanity became lost in the game, like Prospero, and we too fell out of touch with reality, as if Milan had somehow slipped out from under us.</p>
<p>I ask if you can remember because things are different now. I still invite you over to play. You still bring a six-pack of whatever you could get cheapest. Our games used to be painful. We would sweat in our seats, dread the impending mates in our stomachs, and regret a false move for the following weeks. Yes, things are different now. When we blunder, we laugh. The pain comes only after we have shelved the board away, the morning light creeps in between the shutters and onto our skin, and all at once, we feel how much of the world has passed us by.</p>
