    <p>I get so damn tired of you sitting in the backseat and eating all the goddamn snacks we brought with us. I pack them, you eat them. Sunrise, sunset.</p>
<p>"Why don't you come up here and sit with me?"</p>
<p>"That window doesn't roll up all the way. It's cold enough back here anyway."</p>
<p>"No one made you come."</p>
<p>And I always laugh when we stop at Hardee's and you ask the cashier, "Does it come with the girls from the commercials?" when they hand you a bag. But you get all pouty when I take a philosophical stance in opposition to your "Who ran over the Taco Bell dog?" joke. That's not funny. Dogs die. It happens, and it's sad.</p>
<p>We stop at a Subway in Lafayette, and I have to listen to you flirt with the local sandwich artist. "Isn't it ironic that Sun Chips pale in comparison to most other chips?" You never save a good joke for me. I'm losing my appetite on the road.</p>
<p>You pick the music, but I'm stuck with changing the channel, constantly in search of an old school hip hop station to suit your picky taste. Thirty miles north of Louisville we finally tune into something on 105.1, and you get to relax and look out upon Indiana's M.C. Hammber waves of grain.</p>
<p>"Look at that, it's so expansive."</p>
<p>I would if we weren't passing two semis. Someone has to be responsible.</p>
<p>We get a hotel on the south side of 64, and you set all your shit on the bed next to the window. You fall asleep watching the 13th episode of the 13th season of Law and Order: SVU, even though you know how superstitious I get. When your real life ballet instructor gets busted for running a prostitution ring, I'll fucking relish the moment.</p>
<p>When we finally get through Nashville, the only way I can get you to sit in the front seat next to me is to let you drink your souvenir Jack Daniels in the car.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If a cop pulls us over, you're going to have to ditch it out the window. No open containers."</p>
<p>"Hell, if a cop pulls us over, I'll offer him some. Loosen up."</p>
<p>And although we couldn't stop at the Kid Rock concert in Huntsville for me, you won't shut up until we go to the Bernie Sanders rally in Montgomery. I need a presidential candidate to save my 99% ass from the tyranny of you.</p>
<p>The only me time I get is when we finally make it down to Gulf Shores. My back aches hard as I stretch it out. The ocean breeze blows at my Cubs cap and the sand fills the socks I tossed on the ground. I take Gerald's corpse in the water-filled sandwich baggie up to the tide, and plop him in gently.</p>
<p>"Go home to your foreign kingdom, to your people. If only your light could have shone into one more day."</p>
<p>The first time you hug me this trip is when I am crying, staring out on the nautical horizon. You lean your head on my shoulder. It only makes me cry more. I manage to calm down when I think about how you're long like the Mississippi River, but I'm deep like the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
