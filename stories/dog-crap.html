    <h1>Why I Stuck Some Dog Crap Inside the Locker in the Back of Ms. Nicholson's Room</h1>
  </section>
  <section id="story">
    <p>Did you know that Ellie Schnatter stuck some dog crap inside the locker in the back of Ms. Nicholson's room? If you go to Roosevelt Junior High and you have ear holes, then by now you probably can answer the question with a big, fat YES. It's been in everybody's mouth (not the dog crap, ew!) since the now historic event occurred last Friday and the word has gotten all the way from the teacher's lounge to the JV basketball team to the girl's bathroom on the second floor with the really bad water pressure. Still there hasn't been much talk about why she did it. VP Kaessinger called it "a young girl acting out irrationally" while on the phone with my parents. Is this really the best explanation? Or was there actually some good reasons for this case of "acting out?" The good news is the mystery is nearly solved because you, Ms. Nicholson, assigned me this essay where I get the chance to explain my reasonings for sticking some dog crap inside the locker in the back of your room. I did it for these three reasons: because it was too easy, because it was hilarious, and because you deserved it.</p>
<p>First, I stuffed the dog crap in there because it was really just too easy. Whoever designed this piece of crap building should probably go back to 8th-grade architecture class because even I can tell you some stuff wrong with it. They forgot a bunch of windows, they don't know how heating works, and they put a bunch of lockers in random places like classrooms. This design screw up made it especially easy for me to stuff it in there and let it get even grosser and smellier over the weekend in a place where nobody ever goes to, because why would anyone use a locker inside of a classroom? Also, you all act like it's super hard to sneak around the classrooms while everyone else is at lunch, but all you have to do is tell Mr. Moseley you are having "young lady problems" and he'll let you go anywhere, no questions asked. And obviously getting the crap itself was easy because I have to walk Lucy before school anyway and my mom has enough Kroger bags to triple wrap that stuff. When you look at all these reasons, it's obvious that the situation was practically begging me to put some dog crap in that locker. And I would have gotten away with it if John Brown didn't forget his inhaler and squeal about seeing me that day.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Secondly, I put dog crap in the locker because it's hilarious. While poop is just really funny on its own, especially when it's outside of a toilet and especially animal poop, the whole event brought on by placing the poop in the locker was hilarious in another way. First, in the middle of you talking about commas, you started sniffing all funny and walked around to every single person in the classroom and made us lift up our shoes. You even made Paul Crawford call his parents for an extra pair of shoes, which is awesome because you basically just admitted he has really bad smelling feet. Then, when the smell didn't go away you called Larry to the classroom to come look around for it, even though everybody knows Larry can't smell which is why he decided to become a janitor. Finally, after wasting practically the whole block, when you found it, you were so freaked out you fell into Mitch Sullivan's lap and made him shout, "Ouch! My legs!" So you can see that even if you didn't want dog crap in your room, it was still freaking hilarious that it was there.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I saved this reason for last because it is by far the most important one and it's that you deserved it. Monday of last week while you were on one of your twenty minute long bathroom breaks, Timothy Kaessinger smacked my ass on a dare and I punched him in his eye for it, which if you ask me is pretty fair and I could have done a lot worse. But that's not how you think it went down. Hm, who is Ms. Nicholson going to believe, the VP's goody nephew with the red eye (really weak blood vessels) or the girl the principal had to have a stern conversation with about kneeling during the national anthem before field hockey games? Gee, I wonder. This could probably be one of Mr. Moseley's weekly head scratchers (sarcasm if you're still behind in the comedy lessons). And after PLEADING with the administration to do something about it, he gets one detention while I get stuck with a whole week after they get your description of the events. That's not fair, and if you don't see how that's not fair, then you're a pretty sucky person, which only adds to my point that you deserved it, which is the last reason I put Lucy's droppings in that locker in the back of your room.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There you have it, folks, the great case of why Ellie Schnatter did the do with the poo cracked once and for all. It turns out that it wasn't quite as "irrational" as some VPs might have you believe! To remind you of my main points, my logic behind sticking dog crap in a locker was that it was really easy to do, was also a really funny and clever prank, and because the victim of the prank honestly deserved it. Now we just have to wait and see if the reasons why I did it spread out as quickly as the fact that I did. For some reason, I doubt it.</p>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I know these things are usually supposed to wrap up around the fifth paragraph to give my argument a good "structure" and "order." Well, screw that. You know who really wanted structure and order? The Nazis. Yeah, that's right. You might want to move your curriculum around so the part on writing essays doesn't line up with Mr. Taylor's lesson on World War II because as is, your lesson plan has fascist written all over it. And mainly, I still have something left to say: this assignment sucks. Expecting me to write an essay where I come up with stupid reasons to make it sound like I regret something I don't regret is just another moment in this country's crappy treatment of women, which my sister will have you know is really freaking extensive. She's taking a class on gender studies at UNC, the top-ranked public university in the state! So basically the whole state of North Carolina says screw this assignment, screw Timothy, and also, screw you! And if I were you, I'd check the bottom level of the file cabinet below your golden retriever puppy calendar sometime real soon.</p>
