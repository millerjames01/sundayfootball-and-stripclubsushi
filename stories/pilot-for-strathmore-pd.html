  <section id="story">
    <p>It wasn't the first time Officer Lenihan found the silver Silverado parked illegally in the handicap spot on Magnolia street. One tire on the curb, three-quarters of the way into the spot, it was too blatant an infraction to ignore.</p>
<p>Like clockwork, Harold Gotterman, of Handyman Harold's Hardware on 2nd, came marching out of the house waving like a madman, muttering half-swears under his breath. "Just an in and out, ten minutes, left my wallet on the counter, went to the toilet, five minutes, no more!" he narrated, breathless. Directing his attention to the ticket, he said, "Let's just put that away, honey. No need for that."</p>
<p>He flashed a forced smile. His attire, mesh running shorts, worn Crocs, and a 2013 Louisville Cardinals NCAA National Championship shirt so sullied that it must have been superstitiously promising, suggested that he was not going anywhere at all. Lenihan knew for a fact that the Cards played their first away game of the season today. It started half an hour ago. Case closed.</p>
<p>"That's what you told me last time," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, Jerry's out all day on the lake Saturdays, never back 'til around 8. I'll move the car before then."</p>
<p>"It's not my job to keep tabs on when Jerry might want to use his parking space. I'm a cop, not a secretary."</p>
<p>The smile had slipped off Harold's face. He now saw that the feigned Southern sweetness had already failed him. "Yeah, some cop," he said. "Defender of handicap spots and fire hydrants. Feared by truants and porch-drinkers. Protect and serve."</p>
<p>She handed him the ticket and walked off down the street. "Some cop," she said to herself in the universally understood squeaky voice reserved for mocking. She sighed as she ducked into her squad car, a Volkswagen Beetle painted black and white. The City of Strathmore won it in a Louisville Metro Police Department Auction as a much cheaper alternative to makes and models often thought more appropriate for police work.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>Strathmore is a home-rule class city within the metro area of Louisville, Kentucky. Quiet, suburban, the city contains 500 residents, 18 fire hydrants and three handicap spots, two dog parks, one high school (Thatherton), and a police department with a force of a single officer: Darlene Lenihan, a self-identified master detective and procedural aficionado, having watched the entirety of Law and Order, CSI, and all their associated spinoffs.</p>
<p>In the mornings and afternoons, she directed the school parking lot. The in-between hours were largely vacant of activity. She used to stay in her office, a cleared out janitorial closet in a forgotten annex of Thatherton, waiting for calls that never came. Bored, she established a new post, idling in the police buggy on the edge of the city limits, tuned into the LMPD scanner. The plan was that something would be called in close, she could swoop in, showcase her overwhelming competence, and get somewhere seedier than Strathmore. From there, she would catch some crook—with any luck, a serial murderer or rapist—and be given a rank and title of importance she had not yet decided on. Chief Special Psychologist Field Agent. It was a work in progress.</p>
<p>Once, it happened. She responded to a traffic accident near the Newburg 264 ramp. The LMPD officers were befuddled and perturbed by her presence. They largely ignored her.</p>
<p>In the days following the incident, she had trouble sleeping, little appetite for anything but caffeine-infused protein shakes, and a half-pound of hair collecting in the bottom of the shower. Her husband suggested a series of tapes called Meaning of Mindfulness as a remedy to her inactivity-induced anxiety. That was how she had been passing the time recently.</p>
<p>You can feel the individual grains between your toes. Your feet are cleansed in the warmth of the black sand of the volcanic island.</p>
<p>Lenihan felt the heat, but only the heat, as her toes felt stuffy as an unusually warm October sun nuked the inside of the police bug.</p>
<p>Above you, clouds glide effortlessly along the ocean's horizon.</p>
<p>Lenihan peeked her eyes open, only to see hastily sprayed penises on the wall of Thatherton that she faced in the back of the teacher's lot. The speaker's voice was harsh and Scottish. Lenihan's husband was Irish (immigrated to work in marketing for the bourbon business), which almost explained the bizarre accent in the tape. Though it did not make Lady Shrek's timbre any less jarring.</p>
<p>Now, as you go through your day, meditate on this final question: What is the sound of one hand clapping?</p>
<p>Lenihan sighed. She had remarked to her husband that the questions were always too easy, better fit for whichever simpletons normally did meditation. She slapped her fingers against her palm. She wanted a challenge.</p>
<p>That's when the call came.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>"It's gone and the game is Friday. We are screwed. We are monumentally screwed," she said. It was Thatherton's Principal, Margaret Thurman. There had been a burglary. Officer Lenihan was in her disaster of a principal's office, alumni newsletters and phone bank lists strewn all over the place. Thurman's brow dripped thick beads of sweat and her hair overflowed with stray strands.</p>
<p>"Pardon me if this is a stupid question, but isn't the whole thing that it gets stolen every year?"</p>
<p>The stolen goods: Claude Le Cochon, a 3' by 2' wooden pig sculpture. However, to call Claude a mere pig and leave it at that would be dishonest. He was charmingly anthropomorphic. With a letterman jacket hoisted over his shoulder, he stood on two legs and leaned against a walking stick. His head tossed backward and eyes squinted, he was forever frozen in a hearty laugh. Should we all be so lucky to live eternally in a moment of mirth. Each year before the homecoming game between rivals Thatherton and Central High, the prior year's loser would launch an expedition to steal Claude Le Cochon from the winner's school grounds. Then, as their team marched onto the field, they could triumphantly carry Claude with them, cheering and oinking all the while, all good omens for the ensuing game. It was the highest form of culture Strathmore had.</p>
<p>"That's the problem. Central High is crying foul play. They sent an unreasonably bearded senior here disguised as a custodian and claimed it was nowhere to be found. Our football team has since confirmed that Claude is missing," the principal explained.</p>
<p>"We need that pig, Darlene," she continued. "The Alumni Association is gonna flip and we already blew the science fair budget on the football team rebrand. We need to have a nice homecoming or this whole delicate operation falls apart." She paused, envisioning the consequences. "Can I count on you?"</p>
<p>Lenihan nodded solemnly, hiding the grin working to round the corners of her mouth. A case! An investigation! Act like you've been here before!</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry," she said. "I'll get you your pig."</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>Principal Thurman called the primary suspects out of class for interrogation in a tiny, abandoned classroom where outdated teaching materials went to die. Surrounded by world maps featuring the U.S.S.R, American flags just short of 50 stars, and any materials displaying cursive, Officer Lenihan grilled three young men on disciplinary consequences for theft of school property. Versed in Law and Order police interrogation tactics, this was the typical negotiation: scare the hell out of them, then cut a deal.</p>
<p>Two of them looked like the adolescent versions of the nameless henchmen often exploded in action films. Their eyes glazed over during the lecture. The third, dressed semi-formally, fidgeted incessantly in his seat. Thurman had explained that this one had penned an op-ed in the school paper about how Claude Le Cochon was rooted in the school's racist legacy. The original "Claude" was a pudgy French exchange student, who was stripped bare, greased, and then forced to run around the field, dodging players left and right in a grotesque half-time show. Stealing the statue might be a retributive act of political terrorism. During the lecture, all three of the students would simultaneously glance through the rectangular door window. At what? Lenihan was unsure. When she followed their eyes, whatever they had glimpsed had already vanished.</p>
<p>She concluded by allowing them to ask any questions. One of the more brutish students spoke freely: "Are you a cop like for real for real? I thought you were a crossing guard."</p>
<p>The other intelligently followed up: "Yeah, do you get a gun?"</p>
<p>The more squeamish boy raised his hand and said, "I'd like to use my one phone call to contact my father's lawyer."</p>
<p>Lenihan sighed. At once, they all looked toward the window. Lenihan snapped her head and saw frightened eyes and a dyed green ponytail duck out of view. She opened the door, unintentionally banging it against a girl's thigh. The girl yelped.</p>
<p>"Could you please stop whatever you are doing?"</p>
<p>"It's boring anyway. Good luck getting anywhere with those guys," she said, rubbing her thigh up and down. She wore large amounts of poorly applied eye-liner, black leggings under a jean skirt, and a tucked shirt that had Elmo, the Cookie Monster, and Big Bird as members of a heavy metal band.</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Lenihan asked.</p>
<p>"Well, Jack Donovan and Lutz Johnson, a.k.a. Dumb and Dumberer, are useless. Jack tried to walk out of the computer lab with a monitor like no one would see. And Lutz? He punched a hole in a vending machine because he didn't have three quarters for Spicy Chex Mix."</p>
<p>"And?" Lenihan pushed.</p>
<p>"They're not exactly master criminals. If they had the pig, they probably would have brought it to homeroom."</p>
<p>Lenihand understood, suddenly felt incompentent. "I was leaning toward the newspaper kid anyway. He's already tried to lawyer up," she countered.</p>
<p>The girl rolled her eyes heavily. "As if he would do anything to jeopardize his triple legacy at Dartmouth? They're the wrong guys," she said and started to walk off.</p>
<p>"Well, wait a second," Lenihan said, embarrassed, the futility of her interrogation hanging naked and shameful on her face like a greased up foreign-exchange student.</p>
<p>"I'm supposed to be in Algebra 2," the girl said with a wave, not bothering to turn around.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>At home that evening, Lenihan refused to take off her uniform. Dinner was skipped. At 10 p.m., she rebuffed the typical bedtime ablutions that she and her husband had developed. Frowning, he asked how the tapes were going. Lenihan did not want to talk about the tapes. In front of a muted television, she flipped aimlessly through her mostly empty notepad with a headache. The long awaited case had arrived and she was flubbing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When the TV started playing infomercials in the wee hours of the morn, a thought came to her. How many times in CSI was the culprit the first suspect interrogated? How often did the detectives have a hunch from the start that eventually proved true? Practically never. Can you even imagine a show as dull as that? In hindsight, suspecting the usual suspects was a rookie mistake typical of inexperienced viewers. Lenihan felt encouraged as she triumphantly traipsed into the bedroom. She was not floundering, more so stalling, waiting for the slow development of the plot, meeting the cast of guest stars, patiently putting in screen time before the first commercial break.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>The next day, she scoped out the scene of the crime. She went with a student (one of the few tasked with keeping vigil over Claude, another element of the porcine tradition), a slightly chubby boy named Darren who was absolutely thrilled to get out of World History. He unlocked the door to the boy's weight room, where the relic had been hidden under some practice pads in a cardboard box labeled JUST PRACTICE PADS, while he explained that he was the equipment manager, which meant even though he didn't play, he still had a very important place on the team because coach thinks that football is a lot like the army, and it's not just the badass, er, badbutt, soldiers and fighter jet pilots that get all the work done, but it's also the guys who clean the showers and work the recruiting stations in malls and high school fairs and call the wives to tell them that it is with great regret that I inform you your husband has--</p>
<p>"Darren, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have a few questions. Coach told me that the guards on shift before you said it was all good. Then you're up. And then the next morning, Central pulls their little stunt and say it's nowhere to be found. How do you figure that?"</p>
<p>"Beats me," he said, plopping down on a bench. "It was here when I left. I know that because I got it out to check when," he paused and thought for a second, "when I went home." He suddenly avoided direct eye contact.</p>
<p>"Darren," Lenihan began. During his detailed explanation of Coach's martial organization of the team, she had already discovered her angle for the questioning. You always needed an angle to get somewhere in the plot, or failing that, a detective with a dark past who didn't mind playing rough. While Lenihan had not entirely ruled out the latter route, the angle would suffice here. "This case is important to the team. I'd like to tell Coach that you did a great job playing your part, but it's hard for me to do that if I feel you aren't telling the truth."</p>
<p>It was apparently that easy. He said, &nbsp;"You have to promise you won't tell Coach. This place on the team means a lot to me and I didn't want to mess anything up, but I made a mistake, and the thing is, well, I have a girlfriend."&nbsp;</p>
<p>He caught his breath momentarily.</p>
<p>"She comes and hangs out with me while I do guard duty because her parents don't want her dating so she sneaks out here at night. But like I was saying, she wanted to see where it was kept so I pulled off all the practice pads to show her and it was there and then we left," he continued.</p>
<p>"Straight home?"</p>
<p>Lenihan mentally made the jumpcut to the flashback scene unraveling as Darren reasoned his way through his own understanding of the night. Yes, straight home. Well, almost, because Jacquelyn forgot her backpack in the locker room. So I gave her my keys, and it took her a minute, and her backpack was heavy, and no, she didn't want me to help her with it, oh my god, you don't actually think? Jacquelyn wouldn't. I mean, why would she? Please don't tell Coach, please don't tell her, I didn't say anything, you have got to understand that I'm not a quarterback, not a fighter pilot, not even a left tackle. I'm an equipment manager, girls don't usually fling themselves at me, especially not hot ones with belly button piercings and cool green hair.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>Take a long, deep breath as ye step in the cozy cottage tucked away in the silent woods.</p>
<p>Lenihan was parked strategically to intercept Jacquelyn on her walk home from school, and now it all seemed too obvious. It was Scooby Doo Mystery Mechanics 101. Always be wary of the character introduced early that seems to have little connection to the crime. Yet some doubts still lingered. What was the motive? Where was the angle that could lead to a confession?</p>
<p>You look around. A rustic couch awaits ye in front of a crackling fire. Crickle, crackle, tick, snap, bop. The dictated onomatopoeias were always a little much.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn Elise Turner. Junior. B student. No extracurriculars, except a brief interest in Yearbook, not pretty or wealthy enough for cheer. A wholly unremarkable girl. This information was determined through a cursory search of her school records. A few interviews with students revealed she had no ties to the football team. No ex-boyfriends to spite. No French heritage or connection to the newspaper. So why?</p>
<p>You open up your favorite book and the smell of the aging pages overwhelms you.</p>
<p>Lenihan glanced up at her reflection. Her hair looked as though it had been balloon-massaged, and the bags under her eyes would have to be checked if she were flying. Why would anyone lose sleep over a stupid pig? Recognition. Of course. She remembered Jacquelyn in the hallway, so insulted by the stupidity and cowardice of the supposed perpetrators. Perhaps a girl with average grades, no real interests, and practically invisible at school would feel unappreciated and unrecognized enough to steal a pig just to prove she could. That was it; that was her angle.</p>
<p>When the bell rang, Jacquelyn walked down Elm Street ten minutes later, just as expected, while attempting to light a cigarette.</p>
<p>"We need to talk," Lenihan said, blocking her path on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"My mom buys me these. Seriously, you can ask her," she said, shielding her lighter from a light breeze.</p>
<p>"Your boyfriend squealed on you."</p>
<p>Jacquelyn shook her head like she had tasted something unexpectedly bitter, wrinkling her nose. "Oh," she said, making sense of the situation, "you mean Daryl."</p>
<p>"Darren," Lenihan corrected, and Jacquelyn shrugged. "Look, I could get into the nitty gritty of the type of punishment you're looking at and what we can get it down to if you turn in the pig, but then I thought, what's a couple detentions, right? Small price to pay for being the mastermind behind swiping Claude Le Cochon. That's a reputation that will stick."</p>
<p>Jacquelyn looked confused by the comment. She was still struggling with the lighter, a whole lot of sparks but the flame wouldn't stay. "Hypothetically, even if I were to have, hypothetically, taken the pig, who cares if anybody knows? Wouldn't I, hypothetically speaking, already know that I was smart enough to get the pig?" she said.</p>
<p>Lenihan had assumed she would take the bait. What sane detective would ever bet against a teenage girl's desire for notoriety? The lighter finally caught long enough for the cigarette to light. A girl walking on the other side of the street called out to Jacquelyn and waved, which she reciprocated.</p>
<p>"Well, if you're not going to cooperate, we are strongly considering suspension."</p>
<p>Jacquelyn exhaled smoke deeply, politely to her side. "I'm not going to tell you how to do your job."</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>Lenihan hustled between the flocks of afterschool stragglers: debate kids chatting with open laptops balanced in a single palm; artsy kids perched in window sills; the more aimless children huddled silently, unsure of what they might talk about. The negotiation had fallen through. The timeline had been disrupted. It was now unclear to Lenihan how the episode would conclude, but she knew that it was already the final act and time for a satisfying denouement was running out. She turned the corner toward Principal Thurman's office. At the opposite end of the hallway, Darren walked slowly, transfixed by his hand that was smudged with blue ink on the edges of his palm.</p>
<p>"I know who stole Claude Le Cochon," she said, bursting into the office.</p>
<p>"How long will it take? It just needs to have the general shape of a pig!" the Principal barked into her phone. Upon hearing Officer Lenihan, she hung up immediately. "Who? Where?"</p>
<p>Darren emerged in the doorway, mouthing words to himself. Finally looking up, he was surprised to see Officer Lenihan. "Good," he said. "You're both here."</p>
<p>"We are in a very important meeting right now," Principal Thurman said, ravenous for the intel.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and began to read the scribbles on his hand. There was a quiver in his voice. "Coach says that it isn't strength, speed, or smarts that make a man worthy of respect. It is his integrity. If a team is to succeed at the highest level--" He paused and moved his hand closer to his eyes. He was sweating profusely. The script must have become illegible. He improvised: "I stole the pig!"</p>
<p>Lenihan's stomach flipped, and her face flushed with hot, sticky blood. "He's lying," she said to Thurman.</p>
<p>"Where is he? Where's Claude?" Thurman asked the repentant equipment manager.</p>
<p>Darren looked at his feet. He hadn't thought this far ahead. "I threw him in a woodchipper," he decided.</p>
<p>Thurman smacked the table and swiveled toward her window, biting her thumb.</p>
<p>"He's lying. He told me this morning that his girlfriend did it. Her name is Jacquelyn El--"</p>
<p>"I was covering my ass, er, butt. I didn't want to lose my spot on the team." He remembered something and looked back down at his hand. He dictated, monotonously, "But by acting distruthfully, I realized I already had."</p>
<p>"The alumni are going to have my head," Thurman said to no one.</p>
<p>"I can get the pig. He's making this all up. I just need until--"</p>
<p>"The game is tomorrow," Principal Thurman interrupted with a sigh. She half-swiveled to Lenihan. "There's just no time. You tried your best, but I'm sure kidnappings aren't really your forte. I have some calls to make."</p>
<p>The two were waved out of the office together. Lenihan could feel her face swelling with tears. Darren was talking to her, about how in life sometimes you want more than one thing, and then you realize some things are worth sacrificing for love even if it means you have to betray your friends, hurt your coach… She imagined the two of them were out on the football field. In her mind, she was charging into his soft, puffy flesh.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>You are alone in a field at midnight. There are no mountains, no trees, just the curvature of the earth hidden by stalks of tall grass. The night is bright with the light of the moon.</p>
<p>Football Homecoming. The stuff of network producer's dreams. One of the few nights in our sad lives that carries the American verve of a Vegas wedding or a celebrity divorce. When the High School dramas, the shimmering costumes, and the heavy artificial lights of Hollywood are finally realized in the often dreary and dry place we call "the real world."</p>
<p>Even Lenihan, parked in her habitual spot after checking tickets, could feel the magic in the air. Though removed from the scene, she could see all the competing plotlines twisting together to their inevitable ends and their new beginnings.</p>
<p>At halftime, Principal Thurman would present a provisional Claude Le Cochon, hastily constructed by Thatherton's friends at Handyman Harold's Hardware. The wooden pig that resembled a kindergartener's pathetic rendering of the already shameful animal would be introduced to thunderous applause and the sound of alumni furiously scribbling in their checkbooks. Under the bleachers, Jacquelyn would share a Smirnov ice with Xander, the boy with swoopy hair who had keys to the art annex. They would be spotted by the waterboy, Darren's closest confidant. Darren, at home with two months detention and a lifetime ban from Thatherton football activities, would receive via MMS a valuable lesson about cool girls' general apathy for romance. Even Claude Le Cochon would enjoy the evening, laughing endlessly and rolling around inside the spare tire of Jacquelyn's mother's Subaru Outback. He would remain there for a year and three months until the mother would get a flat in the Trader Joe's parking lot. When she removed the cover, she would scream.</p>
<p>The wind blows and the sound of the brush whispering to itself fills your ears. The air smells of sweet alfalfa.</p>
<p>As usual, Officer Lenihan could not concentrate on her tape. Mentally, she was back in her home, red-eyed with nasal-congestion, the night after she tried to beat the LMPD to the traffic stop, the night that her husband suggested she started the tapes.</p>
<p>"Is it really that bad?" he had told her, holding her in his arms. "I know it's boring, but you get paid well, we have health insurance, you'll get a pension. You're not in danger every day you go to work. All those cops on TV, I mean, they're assholes. They hit people during interrogations, they're alcoholics, they shoot petty criminals and get messed up in the head. Is that what you want? Really?"</p>
<p>It only made her sob harder. The audacity. The ignorance and arrogance of foreigners.</p>
<p>And now, I leave you with this question to meditate on: If a tree falls in the forest with no one there to hear it, does it make a sound?</p>
<p>The obvious answer came to her first: Duh. But she had nothing else to think about. So she wondered. How does noise feel if you can't hear at all? What would it sound like to the bushes? To the dirt? To the sky? She flipped on the police scanner and tuned it to a deserted channel. She leaned her chair back and waited for that unknown sound to come to her out of the radio static, out of the sound of snowy television screens.</p>
