    <h1>It Ends With Something Else</h1>
  </section>
  <section id="story">
   <p>Thursday is ugly. Monday and Wednesday have discounted games, Tuesday and Friday have the All-You-Can-Bowl deal, but Thursday has the half-priced beer pitchers and league night. Chief takes song requests, and once a league team is through five refills (for the cost of two and a half!) you better believe he is blasting classic rock as loud as the speakers go. Riot training was recommended all of last year and became mandatory after the Osama Pin Ladens and the Teachers' Union team ganged up on the Bowling Stones during a dispute about the scuffing of the bottom of otherwise pristine bowling shoes, that fateful January Thursday. I try to request Thursdays off, but ever since the Great Dane resigned following the ball buffing accident, I hardly get any days off. Chief says, "Cheer up, Bucky. I never got my days free neither, and now I run the damn joint." It doesn't comfort me though.</p>
<p>It's normally whatever, but by divine intervention, Joe Dailey's dad's step brother (Joe's step uncle) convinced his parents to come to Cincinnati for a two day educational seminar on flipping houses this Thursday and Friday, meaning that the Dailey house would be open Thursday night, the Thursday night before our senior skip day. Not to mention that Alexis Ingles, arguably a top five hottest girl at our school, who I happened to date for three days in the 4th grade, found out she has a long lost identical twin in Eastern Europe, who she will be meeting for the first time that week. Hypothetically, they could both be attending the party. I am not a man of faith, but I believe that at times you have to acknowledge there are greater powers at work. Unfortunately, I have to rely on those mysterious powers to help me get Thursday night off. O-Dawg Millionaire can't work busy shifts on account of his narcolepsy, the new girl hasn't completed the riot training and the next state sanctioned course isn't happening for two more weeks, and Meemaw Suzie struck a deal with Chief where she doesn't work Thursday as a part of her court settlement for the ball buffing accident. Everyone else is already scheduled. All I can do is try to convince Chief to work down a man, which he hates doing because it inhibits his ability to sit in the backroom all night and goof off.</p>
<p>This Sunday is normal business for the most part: mostly regulars with a few randos sprinkled across the lanes. One lady with lipstick sloppily applied showed up without a reservation with ten 8-year-olds (one fresh 9-year-old) in haul looking to get a few lanes for her son's birthday party. When I told her our rates are per lane, per hour, she just got the one lane that was then stuffed with 8-year-olds, scampering across the floor in slidey, oversized bowling shoes (we only have so many size 4s). I asked her if she wanted bumpers on the lane, and she said, "My boy doesn't need any sissy bars." Once the party settles in, Meemaw Suzie starts taking care of training the new girl, for whom Chief has failed to produce one of his patented nicknames, and things quiet down a little bit. I peek in the back and see that the Cavs are up 11 at the end of the third quarter, so it might not be bad time to ask Chief about Thursday.</p>
<p>Before I say anything, Chief says, "I've got eyes in the back of my brain, Bucky. What do you want?"</p>
<p>I start, stuttering and all, "Well, gee, it's just that my grand— ma. My grandma. She's horribly sick lately, and my family's trying to go to see her, the end of this week. She lives up in Iowa. I was hoping I could have this Thursday night and Friday off, and since Meemaw can be here Friday, I'd really only be missing Thursday."</p>
<p>Maybe Chief sees the bit of sweat dripping down my stupid forehead, or notices my stupid voice cracking, or maybe he has some intuition about stupid teenagers, but he rears his neck to look back at me and says, "You trying to bone me, Bucky? Don't be a bone man. You know how I feel about bone men." He looks back at the TV, some woman in a bikini eating a cheeseburger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is referencing, of course, that fact that his wife left him for an archeologist, or a bone man as he calls them. He now has malice for all bone men, and hates them for the allure of ancient mystery and adventure that the name entails. I understand why she did it. I think bone man, I think Indiana Jones, undiscovered ruins, something revealing about human nature that was lost centuries ago, only to be recovered in some petrified wood box with rusty hinges, their satisfying creak after so many years untouched. The only enigma surrounding Chief was which box of leftover Wild Wings from B-dubs was from yesterday and which was from the Saturday before. Even the secret behind that mystery manages to elude him.</p>
<p>I am about to start listing phone numbers of friends that he could call, so maybe they could pose as a relative for me. But before I even start, Meemaw comes in, "Chief, Ace is here. He says the Suitman will be arriving for the LOYBCHT any minute now." Chief leaves the room right away.</p>
<p>Ace, the Bowling Boy Wonder, the Lord of the Strikes, the Ten Pin Prophet, the Calf with Never Gutter Butter, the Lone Bowler, the Protegé, the Prodigy (once Chief learned the difference between the two), Gone with the Pins, and so forth, were and still are his nicknames, but only for the two years I have worked here, meaning there are likely more. Ace is Chief's nephew, a stout and bulky dude, about my age. Most of his trophies are kept behind the counter: Youth Bowler of the Year 2011-2013 and 2015 (he argues voter fatigue prevented 2014, but gave him fuel to the fire for his 2015 campaign), MVP of the Kentucky Youth All-Stars Tournament 2013, Rookie of the Year for the Louisville Semi-Pro League 2015, and a few others that I'm not really sure what they're for. One is a dog doing a handstand on a bowling ball, and the other is an astronaut holding a flag. I asked Chief about it and he said Ace's career has been otherworldly.</p>
<p>I follow Chief out of the room, and he's muttering about the LOYBCHT. The new girl asks Meemaw Suzie, "What's a LOYBCHT?"</p>
<p>Meemaw Suzie clears her throat, and begins to run through a well rehearsed speech we had drilled into us: "Welcome to Lucky Lanes, seasonal host of the," she begins to count the letters on her fingers, "Locals Only Youth Bowling Championship House Trial. $5000 to any person under the age 18 who can bowl a perfect 300 here at Lucky Lanes. That's right, any person under the age of 18, no registration required. As always, bowl lucky!" What Meemaw Suzie neglects to mention is that Chief smooth talked the organizers to let him host it, then refused to advertise it at all in hopes that no one would try and Ace would collect a cool five grand. He had us memorize that speech, but then decided it would be better if no one ever heard it.</p>
<p>So Chief massages Ace's shoulder blades and puts a copious amount of vaseline on his elbow, and I show the new girl how to most efficiently wipe down shoes so we don't hate her when we are trying to leave and the drunken party of six hands us eleven sweaty shoes. Really, I am restrategizing my plan to get Thursday night off, and I decide to schmooze a little bit. "Good luck with LOYBCHT today, Ace," I tell him with a plastic smile.</p>
<p>"Shut up, asshat! Chief, shine the 15 pounder for me!"</p>
<p>"Sure thing, kid. Hey, Bucky, it's this one over here! With the good stuff, not the one for the plebes," Chief says to me.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir!" I say, but I really use the one for customers because I don't think it matters and I'm trying to enact some kind of poetic justice on Ace. I cheese while giving them the ball back.</p>
<p>A man in full business attire walks in. He has a baby face, but it wrinkles severely when he smiles, revealing him to be one of Chief's contemporaries. Chief recognizes him immediately. "Welcome sir, let me get you something to drink, what'll you have? My nephew is going to be playing right here if you want to set your stuff down."</p>
<p>"Cut the shit. I'm here to see the boy bowl and not to make small talk." The Suitman has been around the block before, most well known for running the exposé on the magnetic pool balls at Larry's and then cracking down on the foal labor dispute at the tracks. Chief brought him in to write the story about Ace winning the LOYBCHT, and to serve as witnesses for his run. He says, "Suze, run over and get me a martini. Stirred. Not shaken."</p>
<p>"Right away, sir," she says, grinning coyly. Just as Ace decides his arm has been sufficiently jellied, Meemaw Suzie returns with the drink and says, "I think the real story might be over there, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the birthday party scoreboard has a standout. Hidden amongst the rows of open frames and double gutters, one score is incrementing by thirty each frame, strike after strike; he's at 120, and he's up again. We think maybe it's the mom, but a little boy in a party hat is stumbling up to the foul line, pink 6-pounder in hand. He does a quick 360, trying to build momentum, and the ball spins a perfect hook up the right side. There was some sort of pull, bringing the ball right to the sweet spot. Sure enough, all ten go down again. He does a little jump and claps his hands, and the whole party cheers him on! The mom's on her phone, doesn't really see it. No one really notices what's happening until Meemaw points it out. Ace, Chief, the Suitman, and I, we're all just kind of in awe of it, soaking in the majesty of the game, when she breaks our glare with another comment.</p>
<p>"Now that would be a headline! Prodigy kid steals LOYBCHT title from seasoned adolescent bowler, on his birthday!"</p>
<p>The Suitman squints his eyes, like he is considering the polishing of future local Pulitzers up for grabs. Ace and Chief are no longer in awe. Chief motions me to the backroom. The Suitman takes a seat next to the mother of the party.</p>
<p>I move into the back room with Ace and Chief, and Ace starts shouting, "Oh god! Oh god!" He knocks an empty chicken wing container on to the floor.</p>
<p>Chief says, "I've seen it a million times. His mom's with the mob or something."</p>
<p>"I could have had it all! The cars, the women, the money!"</p>
<p>"Or she's married to Stu, that bastard," (of Stu's Strike Stand) "Reminds me of my wife."</p>
<p>"I could have retired from youth bowling! Went out on the throne. You got me into this!"</p>
<p>"They set us up. She followed the tourney. She… She…"</p>
<p>Ace is collapsed with his head in between his hands. He says, "My hands! They're shaking! You can't bowl with your hands shaking!" He lifts them up to the ceiling hoping for an answer. Speak to me, God!</p>
<p>Chief peers out the door. "He can't do six more. You see that form? It looks Russian maybe, dirty Europe. I knew a Pollack who bowled like that. Streaky people, the slavs. He don't got it in him." Chief says. He looks up at me. "We'll make sure he don't got it in him."</p>
<p>He's licking his chapped lips like there were dabs of pickle relish left on them. "You don't want to work Thursday, and I know five thousand excuses that would work for you right now." I nod. I am complicit in his plot. "We're going to need to be very careful about this. You know what happened to Larry's when the Suitman caught wind of that gig. So just follow my instructions. Ace, you can still beat him, you focus on the bowling. He's got five frames left. Things get down to the wire, you leave it up to me and Bucky."</p>
<p>"Don't fuck it up, Bucky," Ace says.</p>
<p>We leave the room with our heads hunched over like we're in the mob, like we called out a hit on someone, but did it for the family. I am starting to realize that this means I may be an accomplice to ruining a nine-year-old's birthday, effectively robbing him and his family of five grand. I think about the beautiful Alexis and her estranged doppelganger at the party and the moral sting fades a little. From my post at the counter, I think about morality, and what would Jesus have done if he had worked at our bowling alley, but also really wanted to go to a party at one of the disciple's parents' house that Thursday, and Mary Magdalene and her long lost Eastern European twin might be coming too.</p>
<p>The new girl is grabbing some shoes off the floor for a regular we call Deathwish, and I notice she's got a tramp stamp, looks like a magic marker or maybe a dildo. I get a little closer and see that it's the outline of a lightsaber. Once she gives Deathwish the shoes and then struggles to give him the points on his rewards card, I say to her, "May the force be with you."</p>
<p>She goes a little bit pale and her eyes get spacey. She goes, "How did you know to say that to me?"</p>
<p>"I saw the tattoo on your back, and figured you were a fan. That's all," I say; maybe she thinks I am stalking her or something.</p>
<p>"I thought maybe you knew," she says.</p>
<p>"Knew what?"</p>
<p>She cautiously glances around the room. "I'm a Jedi," she says, hushed a little bit.</p>
<p>I try to make some small talk out of it. "Huh. I heard that a bunch of people in England reported their religion as Jedi to prank the government and they got like a couple thousand people to do it."</p>
<p>She scrunches her face and says, "I find that offensive."</p>
<p>"Well, what makes you so special?"</p>
<p>Once again, she looks around a little bit, and says, "I can see things before they happen. Sometimes in humans it's mistaken as quick reflexes. The same thing happened to a young Anakin Skywalker."</p>
<p>"Alright, Princess Leia, you got me there," I say dismissively.</p>
<p>Chief is walking by, swearing to himself, but stops and smiles to say, "Hey, that's good, Bucky. 'Princess Leia.' You could run this place some day."</p>
<p>In the lanes, Ace is bowling furiously. The Birthday Bowler goes slow with so many kids on a single lane, and Ace tries to capitalize on that by going as fast as he can. He gets maybe 4 throws in the time it takes the birthday kids to do one. He grips his slippery elbow between every shot, as soon as he misses he calls for Chief to start up a new game. Each strike he gets has the same sound, so when the strikes skip a beat, he yells, "Shit!" to fill in the rhythm. I don't think the birthday party knows about the prize, but there is laughter and hugging between each roll for them, no matter how many pins go down. The Birthday Bowler does another spin, let's the ball fly, another strike. I can see an ugly vein pulsing on Ace's forehead.</p>
<p>But he gets serious. He gets a few strikes in a row; he keeps rolling; he's gaining on the Birthday Bowler; they're on the same frame. It's as intense as a game of bowling can look to a layperson. Meemaw is next to me at the counter, and goes, "Watch this." She walks over to the speaker system, and turns "The Sign" up to 11.</p>
<p>Ace calls for his uncle. "Chief! Can you get them to turn that off? I need to concentrate here."</p>
<p>I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.</p>
<p>Chief says "Hey, Meemaw, turn it down for a bit!"</p>
<p>Meemaw Suzie says, "But it's his song! It's Ace of Base!" She looks over at me, and rolls her eyes. "He won't do shit; he owes me one."</p>
<p>Life is demanding, without understanding.</p>
<p>"Chief!"</p>
<p>Chief says, "Just try to roll with it kid!"</p>
<p>No one's gonna drag you up into the light, where you belong.</p>
<p>Ace seems like maybe he's trying to use the music, like he's in a sports highlight montage video. He's moving, he's grooving. It's awkward, but funny I guess. Princess Leia is staring at his plump rear. Good for her.</p>
<p>But where do you belong?</p>
<p>His ball looks good, but goes too deep, and he gets all nine but the first one.</p>
<p>"Fuck! Start a new one!"</p>
<p>Meemaw Suzie winks at me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I enjoy the spectacle, seeing the vein bursting on his forehead, the sweat sliding off his vaselined throwing arm, I know that I'm betting against myself. The Birthday Bowler, who ballets to the beat of Ace of Base, gets an eighth strike.</p>
<p>Chief pulls me aside, "We're gonna do a switch. We've got a pink 12-pounder, and there's no way that kid can throw that, especially not with a Pollack spin. I greased it up real good too. You just need to go into the back, and switch the balls before his last throw. It's too simple, but just simple enough to work." So after we run through a few code phrases in case we need to talk again (he decides on, "See you at Bucky-ngham Palace!"), and we slip into the crowd gathered to watch the last frames of the Birthday game.</p>
<p>Meemaw Suzie comes up to me. "Deathwish needs you to clean up some spilled beer on his lane."</p>
<p>"Why can't you or Leia do it?"</p>
<p>"We're trying to watch the LOYBCHT!"</p>
<p>Deathwish comes during early afternoon every Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday. He's an old guy, careful to stretch before he throws, has elbow, wrist, and knee braces. We call him Deathwish because the doctors told him if he kept bowling, the stress on his knees might cause him to lose functional use of his legs. The guy told him, "If it's all gonna end, it's all gonna end bowling. I'll die in that bowling alley." We made a Facebook post about him and his love for the game that drove him to disobey professional medical advice. It got about twenty likes, and I think all he ever really wanted was that acknowledgment of his fatal dedication.</p>
<p>Deathwish smiles at me with the mop. "They say the shaking legs are a warning sign. But I think it's just warning me that I'm about to spill the pitcher," he says. He lets out a hearty laugh. At his age, there is no shame in that. Once he settles back down, he looks at the Birthday Bowler, scritches the few scraggly hairs on his chin, like he's about to lay down some old dude wisdom. "That kid knows it. When you throw, you gotta throw and let God do the work. And if you don't believe in God, you gotta believe in something, and let that work for you. Doesn't matter if he wants to win the thing or not. It's not up to him."</p>
<p>He starts looking over at Ace in contrast, like a disappointed step-uncle might. Ace realized that the speed wasn't helping, and stares down the lane to build up his concentration. He steps to the line, and let's it fly, but he goes down to the ground clutching his elbow. "It's all over! It's all over!"</p>
<p>Chief lifts him up off the ground and says, "Don't worry, kid. I'm sure you'll have the chance to try again. Tomorrow." He stares daggers at me.</p>
<p>Everybody in the alley has gathered around the Birthday Bowler as he heads into his last frame. The Suitman is furiously scribbling into a little pad on his lap, the birthday guests are giddy and giggly in anticipation, and the kid's mom is even looking up from her phone. A ponytailed man from the local news station (the Suitman called them up) has set up an expensive looking, massive camera, on top of a tripod. The scene is set.</p>
<p>I go around to the back. I don't like it back there. The whirring of machines, gears turning rhythmically, I feel like I'm trapped inside a grandfather clock, or a bizarre movie sequence about getting caught in factory machinery. Sometimes I have dreams like that. I guess they're nightmares. Something frightens me about how mechanical it all seems, something set in motion gobbling me up whole, like an early grave.</p>
<p>I listen for the reactions, grasping the large greased up ball, feeling like a philosopher. He begins the last frame. I can hear the drop of his throw on to the smooth floor, inevitable rolling, then the crowd cheering. It doesn't seem right, to try and benefit from his failure. I hear it again, the drop, the roll, the cheer.</p>
<p>I grab the little ball this time before it gets returned. I sit the little ball against my chest and listen to the silence out on the lane. And I can't do it. I'm not some super villain, and it's not up to me whether this kid can win the thing or not. I won't sell my soul for a party.</p>
<p>As I'm setting his little one back in, the greased up heavy ball gains a little moment, and it's so buffed up that it just rolls right onto the return with the little one. I try to grab it, but it's taken up too quick.</p>
<p>I rush out of the back. The crowd is confused at how the ball duplicated. The Suitman takes notes with suspicious eyes darting around, and Chief and Ace are both staring at me with ugly, scrunched up faces. The Birthday Bowler doesn't seem to care though. He carefully surveys his two choices. He picks up one, and I can see it's shinier than the others, and his arms are struggling with the weight. He spins, but this time he keeps spinning, he goes twice, like the momentum from the heavier ball keeps him going. He throws. It's so off; it heads straight into the gutter. But the way he throws it, it's got some sort of weird spin. It pops it out of the gutter, and it gets the pins in the sweet spot. It's good. He did it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole building cheers wildly. The Suitman storms him with questions. Meemaw Suzie and Princess Leia come out with a huge novelty check in the shape of a bowling pin. The mother springs up at the sight of the check. All the regulars are patting each other on the back, clanking their pitchers. Deathwish looks proudly on. Ace clutches his elbow in shame. And I know my fate.</p>
<p>Chief is visibly upset, but maybe he shows remorse. He says, "Great job, kid. That's a lot of money to win."</p>
<p>His mother says, "It's all going to his college education! Well, most of it!"</p>
<p>Chief smiles. Maybe it's for the best they got it. "What do you want to be when you grow up, kid?"</p>
<p>This freshly nine year old looks up at him, grinning, and says, "An archeologist. Like Indiana Jones."</p>
<p>Chief leaves the celebration abruptly, swearing something about a Pollack bone man.</p>
<p>Princess Leia dives into Ace. "Look out!"</p>
<p>"Get off me, you freak!"</p>
<p>And he goes down, landing on his elbow, letting out a howl of pain. They both tumble to the hardwood. Everybody crowded around the lane pauses, and waits for a few seconds, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>One kid from the birthday party picks up the greased ball, but doesn't really anticipate the weight and immediately drops it. It takes out a leg of the tripod holding the camera the news guy brought, and the camera starts to fall right where Ace would have been, where Deathwish stands now. I see it happen in slow motion, like a hammer slowly gaining momentum, the knock on Deathwish's head, his fall to the ground, the bounce of his head on the hardwood like a bowling ball with a high throw. Princess Leia screams. Meemaw Suzie runs to a phone.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>Deathwish died that night. Or technically the next day, if you want to get into the semantics. Meemaw Suzie related the human interest story that the Suitman wrote up to us after she saw it in the news the morning after. The pundits say it'll be up for several local journalism awards. Deathwish's trauma wasn't that severe, but his friend left in charge of his medical decisions said that he always wanted to die in that bowling alley and so elected not to have him resuscitated. There might be manslaughter charges following that decision, but the case looks spotty at best.</p>
<p>I'm not going to the Dailey party tonight. Chief is still pissed at me a little, so I didn't get Thursday off, but I don't know if I would have gone anyway. It turns out Alexis isn't even going. Her twin turned out to be hardcore Eastern Orthodox and the idea of the party didn't appeal to her. Besides, I'm on my way to Deathwish's service. When Meemaw Suzie finds out that he didn't have close family left and just a few friends, she took it upon herself to make sure we could all come, and the only time that worked for everyone else was that Thursday night, after close.</p>
<p>We get into the cemetery around midnight. Meemaw knows the groundskeeper so he lets us in after hours ("He owes me one," she says), and Princess Leia knows a Jedi priest who happens to specialize in night-time funerals services. Leia offered to pick Ace up, but he didn't text back. Chief comes a little late and shows us all a tribute video he made, but the audio is messed up so it needs to be watched with headphones, so we each wait our turn to put on the headphones and watch it one by one on his phone. Meemaw Suzie tears up watching it. When Deathwish is getting put into the ground, we all sing Amazing Grace, but quickly discover we don't know the words past the first verse, so we just sit and hum the verse a couple times over again. After that, the priest has us hum the Star Wars theme and hold hands, and here we are in the cemetery, with intergalactic melodrama buzzing in our throats.</p>
<p>But it feels like it resonates deep within me, past the throat and into my bones, a sinking feeling deep in my stomach, blood to my toes. It is something that I feel with the hair on the back of my neck, the wind through the empty cemetery trees of a late February. Something spooky like a documentary on the destruction of a lost civilization that maybe we were standing on top of. Something mechanical and foreboding: the whirring behind the lanes when I'm closing by myself. Something extraterrestrial, a force within us mere earthlings. Something like lost love. Something separated at birth. Something hot. Something cold. Something divine. It's something. It's something else.</p>
