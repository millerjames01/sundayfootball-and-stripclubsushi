    <h1>The Grand Poobah of Pompeii Oven</h1>

  <section id="story">
    <p>The spot, Pompeii Oven, is one of those yuppie joints where everything is written in rainbow bubble letters on a blackboard and the napkins have prints from classic comic books on them. Fast-casual, student-discount, gluten-free-available, locally-sourced, 5-star-Yelp, Italian-whatever-fusion.</p>
<p>And homegirl looks at you nuts because you are wondering about Caligula's Calzone Catastrophe. She says it shell-shocked like it's an ancient scroll. The gist: A baker's dozen pizza pop-tarts shaped like Lucky Charms' half-moons. Twelve mozz-and-sauce. One mystery. Fifteen minutes. Zero permissible puking. Fifty dollars out your wallet should you fail. One picture on the wall, to hang for eternity in gluttonous glory, should you succeed.</p>
<p>"No one's ever done it before," she warns and simultaneously entices you.</p>
<p>Why you decide to do it, you don't know, but your closest friends could give you theories. Taking on a herculean food challenge on a spontaneous lunch break is such a Dave move, total troll. Also, like, an ironic way of telling Pa, who lately has been telling you to get your fat ass off the couch and do something, to huff a wet sneeze. Maybe just another way of acting out for a bit of attention since Cindy dipped on you. You're always window shopping, is what she told you. It's always something else, is the thing that she said.</p>
<p>So homegirl brings out a sizzling hot plate with the overpriced hot pockets and heads start swivelling from every bugger in the store. The hooky-playing high-schoolers skipping on trig. The daddies on day-care duty. Judging from the mustache, Mario and Luigi's grandmother. Like a lizard in sun, you dig the spotlight.</p>
<p>A skinny guy with the thin-rim glasses, Hubba Bubba streaks an inch off his roots, and two Eastern-inspired sleeves, crawls out of the kitchen looking for "the guy," who is you. He's going to give you pace with a stopwatch. The mystery pocket throws you a curveball. The infinite water cups are a trap. Stick with one unless you want him holding your hair in a high-pony, with both knees kneeling over the throne.</p>
<p>"You don't want the fifty?" you ask him.</p>
<p>"Nineteen people have tried this challenge. Nineteen times that bathroom floor has become a Jackson Pollock puke canvas. Who you think cleans it?" he says and looks vacantly at the stopwatch. "I want this thing dead," he says.</p>
<p>And, of course, the beginning is easy. Microwaved pizza-like products have always been an area of expertise for you (along with PC graphics cards and Ayn Rand) and you're inhaling them at three quarter minutes per. After the first four, one dad says, "Holy smokes!" which you intuit is his version of swearing, and the more squeamish high schoolers avert their eyes. Cheese oozes onto your shirt. Old boy bubble gum hair just trades between you and the clock like he's eyeballing a tennis match, nodding his head in time with your chews. You are Rocky and he is your, um, guy who trains Rocky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, of course, the middle only gets harder. The minutes melt quick like mozzarella in heated sauce. You're sweating. Clock guy's sweating. A toddler has begun to cry. A crowd has formed. The squeamish high schoolers now stare, perversely fascinated by their aversion. Everyone is watching. Everyone is talking. There are only four minutes left. The bloat is familiar to only your most shameful memories. The popcorn garbage bag at the Director's Cut Lord of the Rings trilogy showing. The melting ice cream cake when Pa's minivan stalled in summer traffic. Time is no longer the deciding factor. Just power of will.</p>
<p>The mystery calzone, the ultimate calzone, is s'mores style and the first bite of marshmallow-chocolate hits you like, um, the guy who fights Rocky. Everything in your stomach jumps up and you start doing the cat-furball maneuver. The crowd falls silent. You manage to keep it down, but you don't move. First come whispers, then chatter. You hold the once-bitten calzone in your hand like Eve and the Apple. Clock-guy sighs and you think you're going to call it when Mustache Granny leans in and says, "You're done, gordo," and you hear her, but it's not her voice speaking to you. It's the voice of your father.</p>
<p>You stand up, your ass knocks the chair over, you hoist that bad boy pizza roll up to the ceiling and push the whole thing into your mouth at once. Everybody goes bonkers and you start flexing while you chew and one of the dads does that loud whistle with his fingers and everyone wants to shake your hand and the bubble-gum guy keeps patting your shoulder because it's over, the curse has been broken and you're the guy that did it.</p>
<p>The picture will hang in Pompeii Oven for years and you'll bring a buddy in to see it every once in a while. Coach will come out of the kitchen to tell the tale to them. (Homegirl, unfortunately, will have moved on to an Icelandic-inspired juicery.) Your friends will love the visit. They'll stare up at the picture with wide eyes, and then they will always ask the same question: Why are you crying?</p>
<p>You'll laugh. Tell 'em the same stuff. Burnt the hell out of your mouth on the last one. Fighting to keep the up-chuck down-stuck. You know. Just any thing that works as an answer.</p>
<p>When you go back into the breakroom for the picture, you catch one last glimpse of the dining area. Everyone has stopped cheering and returned to their tables. Fathers feed their toddlers. Teens awkwardly flirt. Grandma squints at her smartphone. The heroic and monumental so swiftly slips into mundane anecdote.</p>
<p>While you wait for coach in the breakroom, there is no noise at all. Quiet like elementary school libraries, when you were a reading champion and could wake up before 2 p.m.. Quiet like night rides home with Pa, when you'd listen to him hum "You Are My Sunshine," as you feigned sleep. Back when you didn't annoy the hell out of him. Like your favorite memory of Cindy, when she slept on your shoulder on the back porch swing and the lightning bugs pulsed slowly over the baby violets in her yard. A stray thought asks you if that was the moment, the moment you weren't hungry for anything else.</p>
<p>It's silent and when you're desperate for any cheer, shout, buzz, laugh, whistle, or ring, the stopwatch starts beeping to let you know your fifteen minutes is definitely up. The tears were about Cindy, but then they're about you. No matter what you do enough is never enough. You're never satisfied and you never feel full. You know for sure because here you are. For once in your life, you're the Grand Poobah of Pompeii Oven and you've never felt so empty inside.</p>
