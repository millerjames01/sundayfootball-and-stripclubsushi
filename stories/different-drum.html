    <p>We got wind the night Roddy and Highland dipped out the bar early. Closing papers at ye olde cracker factory. Couldn't wait the weekend. Roddy said Big H was giving him the skinny on the prevent-Botox that the missus is getting that'll make her look younger than she did five years ago. The guy's good, he's got all types of needle. And for a spell he'd come over and give her an ass shot at 5 a.m. a few days a week. Highland told him to shut up. Whatever happened to a natural woman with a natural ass and some good ol' fashioned breast implants?</p>
<p>Front and center on the building double-doors, there's a flyer. Drum Circle, October 10th at 10 a.m., in the field out by the parking lot.</p>
<p>Bongos, Highland said.</p>
<p>On a work day? Roddy went.</p>
<p>Wasn't up when we left. Who's plugging his drum circle during Friday bar hours? he asked and ripped the flyer down. Waste of time.</p>
<p>No biggie, right? They went up and signed and scanned and composed and attached and sent and ended up snuggled in the lounge room sleeping bags. We had an office check-in Saturday morning. Might as well stay.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>These were our salad days. The business was SoCal home loans and business was good. Money was blowing in the windows and flowing out the water coolers. We were working six and a half days on the bad weeks and seven on the good ones.</p>
<p>And who wouldn't? The fridge was stocked with chocolate-peanut butter protein shakes and the bathroom stalls with blow. T-Bone gave us quotas that we'd double and then he'd do handstands and clap his feet like a circus seal. We'd cheer him on while doing one-handed pushups. It was a madhouse.</p>
<p>All the days were like that, which makes it hard to say how long it was before we saw another flyer. We conferenced with the beep boop business boys downstairs and determined the more you pulled down, the more came back. Hydra-head style.</p>
<p>We were all together that next weekend. After bottomless mimosas with the ladies, we met up at Thunderpussy for Sunday football and strip club sushi. We were passing around the Cubans and thinking, Christ, this is the life. One of those moments God shines a spotlight on you and it feels like your back in the Garden of Eden with sexy Eve looking like a stack of baby back ribs. Everyone else is toiling away in the middle ground, but we've climbed our way back to paradise on Earth. It looked like bills in ass cheeks, salmon sashimi and a Patriots loss.</p>
<p>The drums came up and we all had our own theory. Highland said it was the building super who was doing us dirty. Some hair-brained hullabaloo. October 10th, he'd have a case of cold ones in the field and film our reaction for the YouTube.</p>
<p>T-Bone shook his head, snuffed his nose drip and said one word: Teenagers. TP is out, flaming dog crap is history, and drum circle flyers are it. It's all a big joke to some losers out there. They see people winning and they don't know what to do so they pull stupid shit like this.</p>
<p>We got a few G&amp;T's in Richie and he got crossed off his vape pen and he said maybe it was a collective illusion. We had all dreamed the same flyer. As if that was any solace. As if we wanted to live inside a History Channel documentary.</p>
<p>Roddy whipped out Occam's Razor like a butterfly knife. Maybe (just hear me out guys) there was a drum circle. Maybe it would happen at 10 A.M. on October 10th. Maybe all were welcome and we were invited. That was the last theory anyone said because we all hoped it was something else.</p>
<p>Who cares, eh? Bunch of grown ass men scared of some hippy dippy propaganda. But that's just it. These were the guys we never figured out. Who never pursued careers and floated around in South America, running yoga workshops. Who could name five bands from music genres we had never heard of. The type of guys our college hookups left us for when they outgrew the frat house. Now they're in polyamorous partnerships and succulent filled houses, happy dog parents in Denver, Colorado. These dudes stayed on our mind. Of course they did. We followed their girlfriends on Instagram.</p>
<p>And now? They were coming to laugh in our faces.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>The morning of that fateful day really did us in. Roddy reported his arm hairs at full attention and vision blurry. Highland couldn't have gotten an erection if he tried. T-Bone drank a milk jug of coffee and half-thought to call in, but knew that was a no-go. The Chalets of Sarasota Springs was on. Something was always on.</p>
<p>It rained when we got to the office. No one was working. We kept peeking out the front window, but pretended we weren't. A van pulled up. Cleaners. Around a quarter ten, we had all huddled together looking out on the lot-field.</p>
<p>Where's Richie? Highland said.</p>
<p>Called in, said T-Bone.</p>
<p>Maybe it's off 'cause the weather, Roddy said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beers would have gotten wet, Highland said.</p>
<p>Teenagers. Bunch of losers that'll never know how to win, T-Bone said.</p>
<p>Really, that's the end of it. There aren't any more flyers and we never see anybody go out there except for the landscapers. We bring it up to the super and he looks at us like we're crazy. He gets the door locks changed. Richie claims he won. Collective illusion. Folie a deux. Back to loans like it never even happened.</p>
<p>Well, almost like it never happened. The thing is, if we ever stop clacking away at our keyboards, if we ever call in on a nice Saturday, if we ever unplug for just a minute, it gets real quiet and we can hear it. A beating, a pounding, a funky rhythm from some corner of the Earth where God is surely shining his spotlight. A secret garden of different peoples that burns greener grass brighter: other Eden.</p>
<p>No one leaves the bar alone anymore. Sitting solo in the cabbie's backseat is suddenly too sobering. At the cracker factory, we run the noisy copy machine on blank sheets. Sometimes, we answer the landlines when no one is calling, just to hear the dial tone.</p>
