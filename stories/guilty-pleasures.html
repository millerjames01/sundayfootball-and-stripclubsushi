    <p>We first noticed the problem in the bedroom. Our second date the sex was horrible in a way we didn't even know was possible. There was too much foreplay to start: an unending train of massages, rubs and butterfly kisses. A foreign word came to her mind: empalagoso. Too sweet, corny. The intercourse was anxiety-ridden and self-conscious. Positions shuffled frequently in an all too rare display of sexual over-generosity. We ended feeling as if we both came first even though, after a brief conference, it turned out that neither of us did.</p>
<p>"I think the problem is that we are both bottoms," I said.</p>
<p>"Well, we need to figure it out sooner rather than later," she said.</p>
<p>Since our first conversation, we knew our time together would be limited. We only had three months to flail our bodies against each other before she went to Nicaragua, a gig with a sustainable agriculture NGO. The plan was to be chill about it. All relationships came to an end, so what was the big deal if we knew our expiration date in advance? It never bothered anyone who bought milk.</p>
<p>So we marched onward. Our hookups were the copulative equivalent of the awkward, ritualistic dance of two pedestrians each trying to get out of the other's way, of two motorists both waving the other on at a four-way stop. We incessantly attempted to roll over for the other's advances, a forceful revolution that could have powered a small Mongolian village if the energy could have been harnessed. And if it could have been done, we would have loved it. We were very aware of our place in the global energy hierarchy and we wanted to give back for once.</p>

<p>I was a young white man of average height with shoulder-length, dark hair. I worked teaching poetry to kids in Louisville juvenile detention centers.</p>
<p>She was a young white woman of average height with shoulder-length, dark hair. We were sometimes mistaken for siblings. She worked as a social media intern for an urban farming organization before getting the Nicaragua gig.</p>
<p>Our similarities troubled us. It suggested that we could distill our aesthetics, our ideologies, our very essences into the short bio and five or so photographs that dating apps allowed us. Like you would always end up dating someone more or less like yourself, just a funhouse mirror reflection. Like most technology in the information age, it was equal parts effective and frightening.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>I brought her to a potluck. I made an artsy pasta salad and she made a potato curry. We crowded a picnic table in a friend's backyard with an ambiance carefully curated with burning incense and lo-fi music on a bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>"What an awesome job! The freedom to travel and make a real difference in the world!"</p>
<p>They all said this to her in some form.</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said. "America made loads of money screwing up the economies in Latin America. Now I get shipped in with a full time job to do damage control. Woohoo, justice!" She stared silently into her drink.</p>
<p>No one knew what to say for a bit. I recognized the feeling. I had a similar social-defense mechanism rooted in a fear that I had taken my job in social justice for pats on the back from friends, praise from every left-leaning corner of society, and evidence for myself that I was altruistic, a visible saint, a privileged person but one of the good ones.</p>
<p>"Better than me. I'm a junior consultant for a hedge fund," Thomas said and everybody laughed.</p>
<p>"Well hey, everybody has to make money," I added.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, we get it. You guys are Hitler and Stalin and everybody else is fine," he said, taking a swig of someone else's wine. He had forgotten it was BYOB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mentioned to her on the ride home that if I had forgotten a beverage at home, I would have been too embarrassed to even ask for water. Not that I was trying to shit talk Thomas.</p>
<p>"An honest mistake," she agreed. "We had too much wine anyway."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which only proved his comment about us. We forgave others in a way that we could never do for ourselves. We blamed mental illness. She had a generalized anxiety disorder. I was depressed.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>I began to cling to her. We were eating out together every evening. I had all but moved into her apartment. There, I had my own toothbrush, a separate phone charger, a week's worth of dirty laundry. Her cats, Trotsky and Madonna, no longer ran under the couch at the sound of my Doc Martens thundering on her hardwood floors.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what it felt like? To see all your anxiety and bothersome, self-critical thoughts so clearly mirrored in another person? I was Narcissus, falling in love with my diseased brain's reflection, just as ugly and screwed up as my own. I wasn't alone anymore. The realization made spending time with her dangerously therapeutic.</p>
<p>Dangerous? Definitely.</p>
<p>I felt the threat of her departure date gaining mass and momentum like a snowball hurtling down hill. Our agreement to be rational and emotionally removed about the end of our relationship lingered in my mouth like a dull toothache.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>We eventually tried sex dice as a way to take the overthinking out of our fucking. Of course, the results were either anatomically impossible (PUT COCK IN … NIPPLES), unarousing (CHOKE … FEET), or generally distasteful (GAZE LUSTFULLY INTO … BUTTHOLE). The entire experience was demeaning on another level. What was wrong with us? We were so nervous and timid about our own desires that we had to leave our fate in the hands of some idiotic board game makers and whichever mathematically-inclined deity controlled dice rolls.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>We argued constantly over household chores and concession stand bills.</p>
<p>"No, I'll get the popcorn. You get the drinks," she'd say, shoving her wad of bills to the cashier over my hand.</p>
<p>"We forgot to split the Uber last night. I'll just get both."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you got the cat food when I forgot my card at Kroger."</p>
<p>A line formed behind us. Good. The pressure of a mob helped us resolve these arguments quickly, usually with verbal agreements regarding future purchases. At home, our debates had no limits.</p>
<p>"I'll do the dishes. You called the gas company yesterday," she'd say, bear hugging me around my belly in a vain attempt to pull me back to the other half of the living room-kitchen threshold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I don't mind talking to customer service reps. It doesn't bother me like it does you," I'd counter, pulling away.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean you didn't do it."</p>
<p>Naturally, things became political.</p>
<p>"I should wash more dishes than you. Women have done millions of hours of invisible, unpaid labor since 1900 alone. Reparations, baby."</p>
<p>She tugged me to the ground and began to claw her way over my limp corpse. Trotsky and Madonna jumped on and began to make biscuits on my back. Though they now respected me, they're allegiance lay with their mama.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you personally have not made me do disproportionate amounts of unappreciated labor."</p>
<p>This made me think.</p>
<p>Holding onto her ankles as she squirmed to her feet, I said, "Maybe, but I have benefitted in countless ways from the very same institutionally-based, patriarchal superstructure that made that labor invisible."</p>
<p>We could go on like this for days. We were tabulating machines, weighing emotional favors against gas money against childhood trauma against shared date costs against historical identity-based oppression. Everything cost something. Everything had to be repaid.</p>
<p>Now we were scrambling to our feet, bruises on our bellies, scratches on our backs, and oftentimes loose strands of hair in our mouths. There were no winners in our oppression olympics. Not really losers either. Just tired people.</p>
<p>She did the dishes that night, making it to the sink before I did. But while she got ready for bed, I snuck into the kitchen and took out the trash and the recycling, leaving one Amazon Prime box in the recycling bin and tossing an old egg carton in the trash. It wouldn't have been a true make-up favor if she noticed I had done it and countered with a chore of her own.</p>
<p>Silly. I know. But the minor discomfort of doing menial tasks was nothing compared to another shared fear (a belly fear, far below the brain or the heart, at a depth where the id must surely lie). A fear that we were a burden, that our entire existence served no purpose except to make the world worse for other people.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>For all our similarities, we did realize a few differences in the quarter-year we dated.</p>
<p>As conciliatory as we were, she was completely uncompromising about restaurant choices. Taste of India or bust, one night. Thai food was the only option the next. I was appreciative of her control in the matter, strangely aroused by her greed with shareable appetizers.</p>
<p>We overcame the number one cause of divorce in the 21st century: disparate taste in streamable television shows. It was complicated living in a split-house, but we managed. She and Trotsky watched Netflix Originals in her living room, while Madonna and I Hulued on my laptop in her bedroom.</p>
<p>Little things. I had living grandparents; she did not. She drove an '02 Range Rover; me, a '98 Ford Taurus. The obvious one: I had a penis, which she lacked.</p>
<p>Our greatest difference though was our temperament when we looked at the calendar.</p>
<p>Each day, Nicaragua became less some far off, imaginary place and more a palpable reality, a chunk of land she desperately yearned for. During breakfast, she'd spout off fun facts she had read on the Internet. Fact: Nicaragua holds the world's only dual volcano, fed by two distinct magma channels. Fact: 86 out of all 88 constellations are visible in the Nicaraguan night sky. Fact: The majority of streets in Nicaragua have no name. I took sorrowful bites of my corn flakes. Another day, I caught her looking up apartment prices in Managua. The next, skype calls to her future coworkers. I momentarily spurned my environmentalism and wished for a speedier global warming, for Nicaragua to slip away into the ocean. She began to smile when she fell asleep, sometimes releasing a sigh of sweet smelling breath and relief. "Fifteen more days," she'd say in a wistful tone before drifting off.</p>
<p>God, I wanted to freeze time! To glue back on the pages of the tearaway 365-day kitten calendar she kept on her nightstand. Those nights when she'd fall asleep so easily, I'd wrap my arms around her, pull myself in close and stare at her, her forehead, her eyelashes, the bridge of her nose. If I kept my eyes open, the night's hours would pass slowly, second by second, instead of flying off in a brief mirage of dreams.</p>
<p>But even with my eyes wide open, the skin of my arms taut against her frame, I knew it was already too late. I had already been left behind.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p><span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The night before she flew out, her parents rented out the patio of a bar. In the half-summer, half-autumn night air, she fluttered between old high school friends, first and second cousins, and coworkers she didn't even like that much, all under a canopy of hanging lights. I sat at a table in the back, moping and then moping because I was moping. Why couldn't I just be happy for her? Why couldn't I at least pretend I was? Why did I have to make it all about me?</p>
<p>Driving back to her place, she talked my ear off about the party, then logistics of her trip, her flight times, her ride from the airport into town. I only half-listened, more focused on pushing the knot in my throat deeper inside me, into that pit next to the spleen where neglected emotions go to fester, ferment and grow mold, the pit therapists are always digging around in. She must have noticed that I wasn't responding.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" she said when I parked.</p>
<p>I didn't know what to do. Launch into a monologue about how I was going to miss her and how I had never met someone like her and how her trip was tearing me apart from the inside? Ruin her post-party glow by turning the night into a storm of tears? My emotions burdened me, but I refused to unload them. As if silently grappling with them as she watched, confounded, would solve anything. I hated it. I hated my sorrow. I hated my dumb, gangly emotions.</p>
<p>"Nothing's wrong," I said.</p>
<p>We sat in the car without momentum to walk into the building. I breathed laboriously through my nose. We were covered in light from the street, blurred through the dust on the windshield. I picked anxiously at the plastic covering next to the window controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm just going to miss you," I said, spitting the truth out like a furball.</p>
<p>We had sex that night. Sometimes I think it would have been so easy for that to fix everything. Like all of our bedroom struggles and all my pent up emotions could be resolved in one final fairy-tale fuck fest and we'd go off on our merry ways as really stable, totally not codependent individuals. Isn't that how it happens in rom-coms? Or at least plot-heavy porn? The truth is the actual sex part didn't solve anything. It didn't even make it seem like we made any progress from that first encounter. We never got over our distressed malaise about the transactional aspect of screwing. We were forever unsure whether we were giving enough or getting enough or what "enough" even meant.</p>
<p>But we ended better. There was less frustration when we finished and after-sex felt like after-sex.</p>
<p>I looked at her in the low light, a reminder of all those sleepless nights transfixed by her face. I was warm with the relief that comes from neglecting the mess of hair, sheets, towels and tissues. The lump in my throat had melted away. In that post-coital haze of clarity (in a world with boundless ambiguity, clarity feels like a light fog), all of the hard things became easy to say. My inner-thoughts bloomed outward like a long dormant flowerbud.</p>
<p>My face rested on her tummy and I spoke toward her thighs: "It's not fair to you. I keep dreaming that you'll run back through the security check, pushing people out of your way, and you'll embrace me and say you never wanted to leave. Have you ever seen Love Actually?"</p>
<p>"It was stupid to think we just wouldn't care about the end," she said.</p>
<p>"I hate myself for not wanting to let you go," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I'm sorry that I want this and this isn't you."</p>
<p>For its entirety, our relationship affirmed my belief that the world was horrible. That people like me were raised on stolen land and then handed stupid prizes, privileges, and trophies we never asked for yet rarely refused. That everything we had been given would weigh on us. That we would never learn how to crawl out from underneath that massive weight. But for that half hour before we fell asleep together for the last time, I was light like I was floating.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>I drove her to the airport the next day. We quibbled over who should pay for parking and who should pay for the expensive airport sandwiches we bought. We kissed once before she went into the terminal. No, she didn't come running back out after me.</p>
<p>On the swirl of highways leading home, it would have been so easy to tell myself some feel good crap ("Smile because it happened!") or to have some selfless thought about her. Her snort when she laughed in the comfort of her own home. Her face when she slept. An image of her, thriving, making her way in a foreign land where I didn't even exist.;</p>
<p>But I didn't. I was petty, bitter, unforgiving. I imagined her looking out the window of the airplane thinking about me. Her, three months into her trip wishing she were home with me. Her, in an unfamiliar bedroom, years later, desperately searching for the bits and pieces of me in the folds and creases of a stranger's body. I was selfish and it felt good. My only hope was she would be hung up on me until the end of the earth.</p>
<p>So there I was, angry-ugly crying and clogging the slow lane of I-65. A slurry of honks punctuated my tears. Road ragers flew the bird and yelled at me to take the shoulder, but it was too late. I had already decided I wasn't going to say sorry.</p>
