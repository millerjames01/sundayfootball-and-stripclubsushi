    <p>This summer the ichthyology students have come to town. During the week, they wear neat ironed plaid shirts and stand by the lake with clipboards wrapped in plastic, their wild haired professor with thin rimmed glasses dramatically gesticulating. They bring their own canoes from school, covered with stickers: Save the Bees and Food, Not Bombs. The few in wetsuits dive in with camcorders, the lake swallowing them whole.</p>
<p>The professor, Stavo, explains the plans for his research at our town hall meeting. His telescoping pointer slaps against a projected presentation.</p>
<p>"After recent discoveries of prehistoric life forms clinging to the bottom of Lake Superior, we thought Lake Tenskwatawa merited an expedition of its own," he announces. The townies applaud softly. "And who knows? Maybe we can finally get a good glimpse of Bitey, the Sabretoothed Trout, after all," he chuckles. The crowd laughs politely.</p>
<p>"Bitey has already been seen in plenty of witness accounts," I say. "And we've already sent expeditions to photograph him, but he's camera shy."</p>
<p>My father died on one of those expeditions.</p>
<p>"Yes, I read all about prior attempts to document his existence in the town museum," he says. "But I think we can be a little more rigorous. Technology has come a long way."</p>
<p>I want to say more, but I don't. Town hall meetings are not the place for old fortune tellers like me. Besides, the crowd loves Stavo, taken by his tweed jacket, his enormous stature.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>The ichthyologists are out in the bars on the weekends. They grab the table next to the jukebox and play their music all night long. Queen and Phil Collins. They order mixed drinks the bartenders don't have the mixers for. They are better at pool than the townies. Stavo buys shots for whomever has the stool next to him and jostles them with his elbow afterward.</p>
<p>"Let's get out of here," I say. I chug my beer. "Too noisy."</p>
<p>"I think I'll stay a bit," my wife says and gives me the house keys. She watches the pool game, how the researchers glide the cues between their fingers with mechanical precision.</p>
<p>I walk home on the path by Lake Tenskwatawa. I see their canoes on the shore, lit by cheap plastic camping lanterns. I dip my bare toes into the water's edge by the lamplight. Dark, formless blobs surface near the center of the lake. I can't tell if they are otters drifting in the tide, diving birds coming up for breath, or maybe even Bitey himself. "I don't have a camera," I say. "You don't even have to come here. Just tell Dad that I love him." A glimmering sheen of white bounces back at me: the reflection of moonlight off a blade or a sharp ivory tooth.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>The townies come into their readings with fortunes already in their heads.</p>
<p>"I see a strange man coming into your life very soon," I tell one woman, staring into the expansive blue of my crystal orb.</p>
<p>"You do? What material is his jacket made out of?" she asks me. "What does this man's research concern?"</p>
<p>I sigh: "Nevermind. I actually see bad weather. Remember to carry your umbrella this week."</p>
<p>"I want a refund," she says.</p>
<p>The swirling color drains out of my crystal ball. I put myself at eye level and I see the woman in full definition through transparent glass. No one wants mystery anymore.</p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>The ichthyologists have become rowdier. Saturday nights they unplug the jukebox for their own karaoke machine. They put on "Louie, Louie" and over-pronounce the words. Stavo beckons everyone to dance on the bar. They fling beer bottles at the dart boards. My wife is cheering, giggling herself silly as the bar devolves into madness.</p>
<p>I walk to the lake and row myself out to the center in my father's old boat. He could have died anywhere in this lake, but the water leaves no marker. A silent, opaque plane, hiding an entire world beneath it.</p>
<p>"Did you mean to take him from me? Or was it an accident?" I ask. I spin the boat in a motionless circle. "Is it so wrong that I don't want to know?" The water breaks a few feet from me. I can see a shadow slipping beneath the sheet of the lake's surface.</p>
<p>Lately I have dreams where the lake is like my crystal ball. The blue drains out and the water is left clear. You can see everything lost sitting on the sandy floor. Every night I wake up sweating.</p>
<p>The ichthyologists have left the bar and are running in a drunken stupor toward the lake. They launch their fleet of lantern lit canoes, guffawing and clapping. Their cameras blink and hum in the distance like airplanes at night.</p>
<p>"We are going to get to the bottom of this once and for all," Stavo shouts.</p>
<p>"Don't go yet," I say, but the shadow leaves me behind.</p>
<p>"Avast!" Stavo shouts at me and the light of his lantern illuminates my face as he draws within a few feet of me. I whack him with my oar and his canoe flips. His students yell after me and paddle to help him.</p>
<p>I escape toward the nearest edge of the water. I look over my shoulder at the thrashing bubbles rising from the sides of his canoe. From the shore, there is no way to tell if it's a vicious Sabre-toothed trout attack, a drowning scientist, or a father's ghost rising from the floor of the lake. All is lost in the deep crystal blue.</p>
