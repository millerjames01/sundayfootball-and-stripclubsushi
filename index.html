    <h1>What's this?</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="marker">Sunday Football and Strip Club Sushi</span> is
      the senior show I never had. It's crazy for me to think that I
      have been writing fiction for four years now and have never put
      out something for family and friends to read. When people ask me
      for work, I have no clue what to give them. Now, I'll have this,
      with pictures!
    </p>

    <p>
      That's its reason, but what it <i>is</i> I suppose is a different 
      question. Here in Spain, I realized the work I write has a lot to 
      do with home. These stories for me are pizza roll binges and 
      stress-induced insomnia. They're late-night validation-starved 
      Tinder swipes, going full tilt during pick up hoops, and the fever 
      sweat of waking up to Nick at Nite George Lopez reruns. And eating
      when you're not hungry. And driving for the sake of driving. Oh,
      America, how I miss you!
