    <h1>What's this?</h1>
    <p>
      When I was finishing up my last year at University of Louisville,
      I had a choice to do an academic thesis or a creative thesis. I
      decided I would write an academic analysis of a film I loved (No
      Country for Old Men), which ended up being more about a genre I I     hate (Westerns). I never took the chance to collect my
      creative work and put it together for friends and family to read.
      Most of the people in my life don't know I write. The ones that do
      know I write sometimes ask me for work. I either send a 12-point 
      Times New Roman PDF or nothing at all.      
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it would be nice to change that: do up a little website
      with a lot of stories and a few doodles for kicks. <span>Sunday 
      Football & Stripclub Sushi</span> is the end result of that 
      desire. This mini-collection is a silly homage to, what's for me, 
      the wildest country on the planet and a type of timeline showcasing
      my first foray into fiction writing. I hope you enjoy it.

      Maybe you don't want to read my stories on a website. Knowing my 
      parents' preference for print and a few of my friends with 
      eReaders, I went ahead and made a little printable booklet and
      and ePub file, so you can read my stories however you want.
